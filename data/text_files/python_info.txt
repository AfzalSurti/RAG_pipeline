🐍 Python  Short Notes (Apt Format)
What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax and readability.

Created by: Guido van Rossum (1991)

Philosophy: “Write less, do more.”

Key Features of Python

Easy to learn and write (English-like syntax)

Interpreted language (runs line-by-line)

Dynamically typed (no need to declare data types)

Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

Large standard library (batteries included)

Supports OOP, Functional, Procedural programming

Open-source and free

Where Python is Used

Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

Data Science & Data Analysis

Web Development (Backend APIs)

Automation & Scripting

Cybersecurity Tools

Scientific Computing

DevOps & Cloud Tools

Web Scraping & Bots

Why Python is So Popular in AI

Python acts as a glue language:

You write logic in Python

Heavy computation runs in optimized C/C++ libraries

Gives simplicity + performance together

That’s why almost all AI frameworks support Python.

Basic Python Example
# Variable
name = "Afzal"

# Output
print("Hello", name)

# Condition
if name == "Afzal":
    print("Learning Python")
